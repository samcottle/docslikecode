# Learning Dutch

Duolingo is great, but it's nice to have a cheat sheet to help you as you're learning. So here are rough notes that I took whilst learning Dutch.

## Adjectives

Generally speaking, an adjective that comes before a definitive noun gets a **-e**. For example:

> De oude hond.

And:

> Het grote huis.

But if it's before an indefinite noun (**a** something, or **an** something), **de** words get a **-e**, but **het** words don't. For example:

> Een oude hond.

But:

> Een groot huis.

If there's no article, then use the same rule as indefinite. For example:

> Lekkere koffie. (de)

And:

> Koud water. (het)

## Verbs

As a rule of thumb, Dutch uses what is called *V2 word order*. This is where the verb is the second element in a sentence. For example:

> Ik eet een boterham.

(As another rule of thumb, the Dutch language has so many exceptions that you can't take any rule as gospel. That includes this rule around V2 word order.)

### Inversion
Words can also be places at the beginning of a sentence to give them emphasis. This is called *inversion*. For example, if you want to emphasize that you're eating that sandwich *now*:

> **Nu** eet ik een boterham.

### Adverbs

Adverbs tell you something about the time, place or manner of a verb/adjective. Where you place the adverb depends on whether it is definite (**the** something) or indefinite (**a** something).

Adverbs come after a definite object. For example:

> Ik eet de boterham **nu**. (I am eating **the** sandwich now)

But before an indefinite object. For example:

> Ik eet **nu** *een* boterham. (I am eating **a** sandwich now)

## Conjunctions

These are used to connect two sentences or phrases. The most commonly used conjunctions are *en*, *of*, *maar*, *want*, and *dus*.

Nearly all other conjunctions are referred to as *subordinating conjunctions* (i.e. they have a subordinate clause: one that can't function as a sentence in its own right). Examples include:

- Contrast: *hoewel* (although/even though)
- Cause: *omdat* (because), *doordat* (because)
- Consequence: *zodat* (so that)
- Condition: *als* (as/if), *tenzij* (unless)
- Time: *terwijl* (while), *zodra* (as soon), *wanneer* (when), *totdat* (until), *voordat* (before)

These use a different word order. Instead of the verb-second word order, the verbs in subordinate clauses are always at the end. For example:

> Het boek is duur, omdat het oud **is** (the book is expensive because it is old).

But when the subordinate clause comes before the main clause (which is done for emphasis), then the main clause is inverted (the subject and verb switch places). for example:

> Waneer het koud is, **draagt zij** een jas (when it's cold, she wears a jacket).

## Prepositions and circumpositions

A *preposition* comes before a noun, and describes its location or direction. Examples are *met* (with), *naar* to, *voor* and *achter* (before and after), *naast* (next to), *beneden* and *boven* (below and above), *onder* and *over* (under and over), *bij* (at or near), *op* (on), *tussen* (between), *binnen* and *buiten* (inside and outside).

In Dutch they also have *circumpositions*. These are similar to prepositions, but split in two parts that are placed before (i.e. *preposition*) and after (*postposition*). An example is *naartoe*, which in most sentences is split into *naar* and *toe* (*Ik ga naar jou toe.* - I am going **towards** you), to imply direction. Here are some more examples:
- *achteraan*: *achter* and *aan*, to imply moving **behind**.
- *doorheen*: *door* and *heen*, to imply going **through**.
- *naartoe*: *naar* and *toe*, to imply going **towards**.
- *omheen*: *om* and *heen*, to imply going **around**.
- *onderdoor*: *onder* and *door*, to imply going **underneath**.
- *overheen*: *over* and *heen*, to imply going **across**.
- *tussendoor*: *tussen* and *door*, to imply going **in-between**.
- *vanaf*: *van* and *af*, to imply going **away from**.

## Quirks

Many Dutch words are often used quite differently to English. There are also a number of other arbitrary rules. I'll explain some of the obvious ones in this section.

### Er

Er generally translates to "there", but is often used differently in Dutch.

There are five different ways it can be used in Dutch, so there could be (and may be in future) a separate pages of notes dedicated to this two letter word.

But for now think of it as follows: It is often necessary to include *er* when the subject is indefinite. And in this case *er* usually comes after the verb, to place emphasis on it.

For example:

> "Wie slaapt er in mijn bed?" (who is sleeping in my bed?)

### Omdat vs. Want

Both translate to *because*. But...

*Omdat* is used to give a reason for something:

> Haar huis is blauw, omdat blauw haar lievelingskleur is. (Her house is blue because it's her favourite colour)

*Want* is used to explain why you said something:

> We moeten snel gaan pauzeren, want ik begin echt moe te worden (We must take a break soon because I am getting really tired).

But a lot of the time, they can be used interchangeably. For example:

> Ik doe de verwarming aan, omdat het koud is. (I switch on the heater because it is cold)

Or:

> Ik doe de verwarming aan, want het is koud. (I switch on the heater because it is cold)

### Geen vs. niet

Use **geen** to negate an **een**:

> Dat is geen man.

And:

> Zij hebben geen boek.

Use **niet** in all other situations:

> Ik ren niet. (I am not running)

And:

> Hij is niet zo oud. (He is not so old)

### Hebt vs. heeft

Does someone *have* something? If you're talking to someone directly they *hebt* it. But if you're referring to someone in the third person, they *heeft* it. For example:

> Je **hebt** een ui. (You have an egg)

But:

> Hij **heeft** een ui. (He has an egg)
