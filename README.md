I created this repo as I was working through the excellent [*Git and GitHub for writers* course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/git-and-github-for-writers/).

This is basically my personal cheat-sheet on the Git and its commands, as used for a [Docs Like Code](https://www.docslikecode.com/) workflow.
